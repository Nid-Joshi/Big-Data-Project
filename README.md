# Big-Data-Project
Data processing &amp; Machine learning in Google Cloud

File Name and Decription :

BD_Coursework.ipynb : The file is organized into five sections. The first three sections include code for data preprocessing, parallelizing the preprocessing process in Spark using Google Cloud Dataproc, and parallelizing the evaluation of various configurations with Spark. In the subsequent sections, the preprocessed data is utilized in TensorFlow/Keras, where different parallelization strategies for multiple GPUs are tested. Additionally, the report covers cherry-picking and hybrid parallel training of convolutional neural networks, drawing insights from two referenced papers.
